"Comprehensive Summary of the PLCnext Technology Starterkit and Its Architecture
Introduction to PLCnext Technology
PLCnext Technology is Phoenix Contact’s innovative and forward-thinking response to the changing demands of the industrial automation sector. As industries shift towards smarter, interconnected, and cloud-integrated environments, traditional programmable logic controllers (PLCs) must evolve. PLCnext Technology bridges the gap between conventional PLC environments and the open, collaborative development world of high-level programming languages, cloud systems, and real-time control.

PLCnext provides the openness of a Linux-based platform with real-time capabilities and combines multiple programming languages such as IEC 61131-3, C++, C#, and MATLAB® Simulink®. It allows developers from different domains to work in parallel, thus reducing development time while increasing flexibility and scalability."

"Architecture and System Design
PLCnext Technology runs on a Linux-based operating system enhanced for real-time operations. Its architecture is divided into several critical core components:

1.Middleware (GDS - Global Data Space):
Facilitates seamless data exchange between tasks and programs.
Ensures synchronization across different programming languages and tasks.
IN and OUT ports control how data flows between modules, ensuring consistency even in multi-task/multi-core scenarios.

2.ESM (Execution and Synchronization Manager):
Manages and synchronizes real-time tasks.
Supports multicore CPUs by allocating separate ESMs per core.
Works with IEC, C++, and Simulink programs in unified task cycles.

3.System and Service Components:
System Manager, PLC Manager, OPC UA server, Web-based Management (WBM), VPN, SSH, NTP, and firewall services.
Service components also enable secure communication, remote diagnostics, and performance monitoring.

4.Application Control Framework (ACF) and Program Library Manager (PLM):
ACF loads and manages user-defined firmware components.
PLM instantiates runtime libraries (.so) and assigns them to ESM tasks.

5.Remote Service Calls (RSC):
Allows communication between internal user components and core services.
Can be used to read/write GDS data, access fieldbus devices (Axioline, PROFINET), or retrieve system states."
"Programming and Development Tools
1.C++ Development:
Phoenix Contact offers an Eclipse add-in and an SDK.
Developers use metafiles (*.libmeta, *.compmeta, *.progmeta) to define ports and configurations.
Code is compiled into shared libraries and loaded onto the controller.

2.C# Programming:
Integrated via a Visual Studio® extension.
C# libraries are converted into firmware components and used like traditional IEC blocks.

3.Simulink Models:
Engineers can model, simulate, and deploy MATLAB® Simulink® designs directly on PLCnext hardware using the “PC WORX TARGET FOR SIMULINK”.

4.Configuration Options:
Can be done via PC Worx Engineer or manually through XML files (*.acf.config, *.gds.config, *.esm.config).
Allows manual extension and custom configuration using SFTP and standard text editors."
